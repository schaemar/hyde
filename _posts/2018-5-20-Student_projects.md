I would like to share some of the projects I am working on at Artificial Intelligence Center (AIC).
We just published topics for bachelor's and master's theses.

We are at the end of the summer semester, so it's the time when the students are recommended to choose their graduation thesis's topics. It's about a year before their submission deadline for the thesis.
A common practice at FEE CTU is that the students choose an adviser and with the adviser, they come up with a topic that fits the adviser's research profile and student's interests and her/his study program.
The topic is usually not a final assignment. We typically start the cooperation with an introduction period. We offer student summer jobs, and it's a quite well-received form of cooperation.
The next semester, the students have software/research project course. The goal of the project course is to start to work on their graduation projects. By Christmas, we finalise the specific final thesis assignment for the students.
