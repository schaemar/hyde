I would like to share some of the projects we are working with our <a href="sum.fel.cvut.cz">Smart Urban Mobility</a> team at Artificial Intelligence Center (<a href="aic.fel.cvut.cz">AIC</a>).
We just published <a href="sum.fel.cvut.cz/theses">topics for bachelor's and master's theses</a>.

We are at the end of the summer semester, so it's the time when the students are recommended to choose their graduation thesis's topics. It's about a year before their submission deadline for the thesis.
A common practice at <a href="cs.fel.cvut.cz">CS FEE CTU</a> is that the students choose an adviser and with the adviser, they come up with a topic that fits the adviser's research profile and student's interests and her/his study program.
The topic is usually not a final assignment. We typically start the cooperation with an introduction period. We offer student <a href="sum.fel.cvut.cz/jobs">summer jobs</a>, and it's a quite well-received form of cooperation.
The next semester, the students have software/research project course. The goal of the project course is to start to work on their graduation projects. By Christmas, we finalise the specific final thesis assignment for the students.
